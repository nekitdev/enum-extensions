# Traits

## Prerequisites

Code snippets and examples below are using several common imports and types,
which are mainly omitted for simplicity:

```python
from enum_extensions import (  # library imports used in examples
    # enumerations
    Enum,
    IntEnum,
    # traits
    Trait,
    OrderTrait,
    FormatTrait,
    TitleTrait,
    # auto items
    auto,
)
```
